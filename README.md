# Basic Tetris App

This is a basic Tetris app that I created while following along with freeCodeCamp's Youtube video tutorial "Code Tetris: JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners" found on the following link https://youtu.be/rAUn1Lom6dw by Ania Kubow. 

The goal of the project was to learn more about built-in JavaScript methods, game development in JavaScript, and to explore the basics of the popular Tetris game.

The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game includes basic functionality such as moving pieces left and right, rotating them, and dropping them down the grid. This can be performed by using the arrow keys on a keyboard. The game also includes a simple scoring system, which rewards players for clearing lines of blocks.

Overall, this project was a fun way to learn more about game development in JavaScript, and to get some hands-on experience building a classic game from scratch. While the app is fairly basic, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish with it and I hope others will find it a helpful resource for learning more about game development in JavaScript.

Feel free to check out the code and try the app for yourself!
